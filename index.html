            <h2>What is Doyenne Inspiration?</h2>
            <p>Doyenne Inspiration is an annual FIRST Robotics offseason competition dedicated to empowering female and nonbinary students in STEM across North Carolina. Founded in 2018 by FIRST Robotics Team 5190, Falcon Fury, Doyenne Inspiration provides an inclusive, hands-on environment for students to design, build, and compete while developing their technical and leadership skills. The name “Doyenne”, meaning a woman who is the most respected or prominent person in a particular field, captures our vision to inspire every participant to become a leader and innovator in STEM.</p>
            <p>Doyenne Inspiration serves as more than just a competitive robotics event. It’s a platform for empowering female and nonbinary students to become STEM leaders. Doyenne provides an arena where students can hone their technical skills beyond the regular season. Whether it’s programming, mechanical design, or electrical engineering, off-season events help keep minds engaged and abilities sharp.</p>
