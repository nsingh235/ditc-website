            <h2>What is the Doyenne Inspiration Team Council (DITC)?</h2>
            <p>The Doyenne Inter-Team Council is a student-led organization composed of students from FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams across North Carolina. Founded in 2025, the Council was founded to expand the reach and impact of Doyenne Inspiration by connecting teams across the region, sharing ideas, and supporting one another in creating more inclusive spaces in robotics. Our goal is to empower girls and nonbinary students in STEM by planning and organizing the annual Doyenne Inspiration competition, hosting events that highlight diversity, leadership, and STEM opportunities, and building a supportive community where every voice is heard, valued, and inspired to lead.</p>
